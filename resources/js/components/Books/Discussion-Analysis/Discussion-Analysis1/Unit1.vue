           <p>Advertising does not sell a product, but it plays an essential role in selling a product. It helps in increasing sales by getting people's attention, thus, making them, especially the target market, become fully aware and informed about the different brands and the product availability in the market.</p>
           <p>In simple terms, advertising is a way to promote a product or a brand using different mediums. If a product is advertised well and its information reaches to the masses, the chance of it being sold too increases. </p>

       <p>The medium through which products are advertised plays a vital role in advertising a product. It should easily be accessible to the public and popular among the masses. If the media chosen for advertising is popular amongst the masses then the chances of more people getting to know about it increases. Hence, popularity of the medium is very important, perhaps the most important factor for an advertising media.</p>
 
       <p>The most commonly used advertising media are:</p>

          <ul style="margin: 12px;">
            <li>Television</li>
            <li>Radio</li>

        <p>Television is an excellent media for advertising as it is one of the most commonly used mediums by the masses, thus reaching a large number of people. It can help convey messages using sight, sound, and motion. When done accordingly, it can attract people toward itself and the product.</p>
        <p>Though television is one of the best mediums for advertising, it does have its downsides. The cost of advertising is really high, especially during the most watched programs. Not only that, you also need to spend a relatively high amount for its production.</p>

        <p>Radio is a universal medium enjoyed by people at one time or another during the day, at home, at work, and even in their cars. It can reach areas where people don't have television.</p>
        <p>Television ads can cost tens of thousands of dollars and take months to be produced, while $1,500 will likely get a radio spot produced and on the air quickly, according to StrategicMedia.</p>
        <p>Radio ads can be done through audio radio commercials or the host of a show can be paid to promote the product.</p>
        <p>Since the radio commercials are audio and not visual it's important that the audio commercial is well spoken and has sounds and words that catch the attention of the listener.</p>
        <p>The best way however, to promote something through radio is via a popular host or an RJ, someone people listen to or follow.</p>
        <p>But because radio listeners are spread over many stations, you may have to advertise simultaneously on several stations to reach your target audience. Listeners cannot go back to your ads to go over important points and most of them are doing something else while listening, which means that your ad has to be special to get their attention </p>

        <p>Print is the oldest means of advertisement. The different types of print advertising include newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, yellow pages, brochures, and flyers.</p>
        <p>Print, especially newspapers have large diverse audiences so it tends to be effective when looking to raise awareness levels. However, the chances of getting people under 30 to read the newspaper is not that high, so if your target market is the youth, you better steer clear of newspaper advertising.</p>
        <p>Print is generally the cheapest way of advertisement in reaching a mass audience. The price of your print ad depends on the print's popularity and your ad's size. With so many different ad sizes available, you can probably find a size that fits your budget. People can also go back to your advertisement for as long as they desire.</p>
        <p>Print also has its disadvantages. Newspapers carry many ads so your ad has to compete against the clutter of other advertisers, including the giant ads run by supermarkets and department stores as well as the ads of your competitors. If you are not using a magazine, your creativity is also limited because of the poor photo reproduction.</p>

        <p>Online advertising is the newest medium of advertising. It combines the advantages of print and television and reaches an unlimited audience through the Internet. It can also be considered as the best medium for advertising of the modern time. </p>
        <p>Ads can be given on the sides of popular websites most importantly on social networking websites that are extremely popular amongst the youth. Fan pages and groups of communities of many brand companies are made by many social networking sites where advertisements for new launches and products by the companies are given.</p>
