        <p>Violent video games have been blamed for gruesome incidents faced around the world today such as school shootings, bullying, and violence towards women. Some would argue that these games desensitize players to violence and teach children that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts. Others would contend that most of the research on the topic are deeply flawed and that no causal relationship has been found between video games and social violence. They argue that violent video games may reduce violence by serving as a substitute for rough and tumble play and by providing a safe outlet for aggressive and angry feelings.

                      <b>Affirmative</b><br>
                      In most violent games, the more people one kills, the greater the reward is, or the higher the score is. Most video games often reward players for simulating violence, and thus, enhance the learning of violent behaviors. This might just be the cause for another case of a boy pulling the trigger on his sleeping father. -Lucas

                      <b>Negative</b><br>
                      Research cannot fully justify the link between video games and youth violence. There is no direct link between the two. -Paige

                      <b>Affirmative</b><br>
                      Violent video games can cause players to associate pleasure and happiness with the ability to inflict pain to others. It has the tendency to make them feel superior if others are afraid that they might lose it" and start hitting people. -Lindsay B.

                      <b>Negative</b><br>
                      Youth violence must be blamed on bad parenting. Parents are responsible for their children's upbringing. Let us not blame Tekken for children who grew up with irresponsible parents. -Yankee

                    <p>
                      <b>Affirmative</b><br>
                      Young children are more likely to confuse fantasy violence with real world violence. They may believe that violence is a very natural reaction and may mimic violent acts to get their own way. - Garry V.

                      <b>Negative</b><br>
                      Violent video games offer healthy and safe opportunities for children to virtually discover rules and consequences of violent actions. Violent games also allow young people to experiment with issues such as war, violence and death without real world consequences. -Anonymous
