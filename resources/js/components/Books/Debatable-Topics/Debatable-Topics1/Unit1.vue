        <p>Morality and religion are known to be the relationship between religious view and morals. It has always been believed that religion is the guiding framework in determining right from wrong. While this is so, many argue that a man who does not have any religious inclination is capable of living a moral life. What do you think?

                      <b>Affirmative</b><br>
                      There is no reason to believe that a child could not be raised in a society where there is no exposure to religion, but a thorough grounding in ethical values instead, and have that child grow up to lead a fulfilling and productive life. -Stanley

                      <b>Negative</b><br>
                      It's impossible for Man, collectively, to live a moral life without religion. Simply stated; the development of concepts of morality and justice are so inextricably linked to religion as to be inseparable. -Susan

                      <b>Affirmative</b><br>
                      We daily witness others that seem to live a proper life. Most consider a person moral if he is a law-abiding citizen. Is religion ever mentioned? No. -Phil C.

                      <b>Negative</b><br>
                      I'm not sure that a law-abiding life and a moral life are the same thing. If I want to kill, steal, and otherwise do horrid things and I only refrain because I'm afraid of getting caught and punished, am I, in fact, a moral person? -Benp 21:14, 19 February 2009 (EST)

                      <b>Affirmative</b><br>
                      Morals rely on respect. The argument that we need religion for morals is because of the fear of the higher power punishing us for breaking laws of morality. Morality is a social construct depending on the environment, not always a spiritual one. -Nonobu

                      <b>Negative</b><br>
                      Christians believe that every man is born with the original sin therefore man, by nature is evil. Because of religion, we are redeemed from our evil ways and are therefore able to live a moral life. -Heidi
